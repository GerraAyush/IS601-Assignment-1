Hello! This readme file contains a small cheat sheet for Linux and Git commands.
Git commands:
1. git init := initialize an existing directory as a Git repository.
2. git status := show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit.
3. git add [file] := add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage).
4. git commit -m “[descriptive message]” := commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot.
5. git remote add [alias] [url] := add a git URL as an alias.
