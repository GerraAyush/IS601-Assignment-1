Hello! This readme file contains a small cheat sheet for Linux and Git commands.
Git commands:
1. git init := initialize an existing directory as a Git repository.
2. git status := show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit.
3. git add [file] := add a file as it looks now to your next commit (stage).
4. git commit -m “[descriptive message]” := commit your staged content as a new commit snapshot.
5. git remote add [alias] [url] := add a git URL as an alias.
6. git push [alias] [branch] := Transmit local branch commits to the remote repository branch.
7. git merge [alias]/[branch] := merge a remote branch into your current branch to bring it up to date.
8. git pull := fetch and merge any commits from the tracking remote branch.

Linux commands:
1. diff [OPTION|S] FILE1 FILE2 := display the differences in the files by comparing the files line by line.
